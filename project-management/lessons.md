## Calibration lessons

Lessons accumulated through April-May:

- **Brief authoring rules now mandatory.** Every executor brief specifies model selection, worktree requirement, file scope boundaries, stop conditions, deliverable format.
- **Verify SPEC-A before going to SPEC-B.** When a brief tells the agent to prefer one path, the agent must demonstrate the preferred path is impossible before choosing the alternate.
- **Generic tools beat per-team handlers.** The catalog framing requires `vada__consult` to accept `spec_id` and route to any YAML.
- **Diagnose before designing.** Read-only diagnostic before fix briefs; visual verification via screenshots before merge.
- **Specs can lie. Implementations don't.** The BYOK structural-promise gap had been there for an unknown duration; only revealed by audit.
- **Three parallel agents is sustainable.** Different worktrees, different file scopes, different branches from `origin/main`.
- **Don't test on prod.** Wildcard preview domains for multi-developer teams.
- **PR-mergeability ≠ branch-pushed-to-origin.** Force-pushing a worktree to origin syncs origin/branch, but does NOT guarantee the PR will merge cleanly into main.
- **Pre-push verification must include production build.** Local typecheck/lint pass with all dev deps installed; Vercel uses `--frozen-lockfile` and stricter resolution.
- **UX coherence walkthrough must precede architectural lock.** "What does the user click? What does it mean? What state do they end up in?" — should have killed the two-store sync architecture immediately if asked when D-029 was first locked. Cost: a sync bug surfaced within minutes of feature use, multiple review rounds, and an architectural reversal (D-028) within the same week.
- **Vercel "Sensitive" env var flag hides the Value field on Edit.** Pasting into the Notes field instead of Value passes silently. `vercel env pull` is the only reliable verification path for the project owner. Hours-long debugging marathon caused by this. See D-029 Consequences.
- **Vercel Hobby plan suppresses function stdout/stderr in dashboard UI.** Diagnostic console.error PRs are useless on Hobby. Local debug via `vercel env pull` + `bun run dev` is the correct path.
- **SHA-256 + unique index is the right hash mechanism for short-lived bearer tokens with high entropy.** bcrypt's per-request CPU cost is unjustified when the token has 256 bits of randomness and the lookup uses an indexed unique constraint.
- **Sycophancy at architectural decision points is dangerous.** Reflexive flipping when challenged is just as bad as defending a wrong choice. The right answer requires reasoning, not capitulation.
- **When something feels uncannily like a spec we already wrote, check if we already wrote it.** May 6: Claude got excited about a project management framework idea before noticing it was already specced as Cetana V0/V0.7. Pattern: pivots to "shiny new architectural ideas" mid-execution. Counter: pause, search project knowledge for the closest existing concept, then decide whether to investigate.
- **Research synthesis often duplicates existing spec work.** May 8: a parallel research thread (Gemini, Grok, ChatGPT — multi-agent orchestration patterns) returned five "convergent patterns." Three were already in `vada-reviewers-spec.md` rev 4. The fix wasn't a new principles doc — it was a rev 5 patch to the existing spec. Always check the relevant spec first; new research usually patches existing specs rather than spawning new ones. Standalone principles docs risk drifting from implementation.
- **Self-hosted MCP servers with bearer-token auth currently fail through Claude.ai's connector broker.** May 7-8: Vāda's hosted MCP at `vada.attalabs.dev/api/mcp` is healthy and works via Claude Code CLI, but Claude.ai web rejects it with `ofid_*` broker errors. GitHub's hosted MCP at `api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/` works via OAuth. Different code paths in Anthropic's broker. Workaround for Vāda users today: Claude Code CLI. Future hardening: add OAuth as an alternative to bearer auth (Track E12). Reconfirmed May 9 (third reproduction; consistent failure mode).
- **Validate the existential dependency before building the product around it.** May 9: Cetana V0 was almost designed and partially built before validating that Claude Code (headless mode) could actually call a custom MCP tool that blocks for arbitrary duration and resumes coherently. Slice -1 prototype (~100 lines, 2 hours) settled the question definitively. Generalizable rule: if the entire product depends on one technical mechanism nobody has confirmed at runtime, prototype that mechanism in isolation before designing anything around it.
- **Reviewer pressure-testing materially improved the Cetana architecture.** May 9: Multi-AI synthesis caught a fatal architectural assumption (web Claude.ai cannot reach localhost MCP servers — only Claude Desktop can). Without that catch, V0 would have been built on impossible plumbing. Generalizable rule: when an architecture depends on a transport assumption, verify it against vendor docs before locking the spec.
- **PM docs in repo > project knowledge.** May 9: migrating `coordination.md`, `state.md`, `plan.md`, `brief-authoring-rules.md` from Claude.ai project knowledge to `project-management/` in the repo eliminated the manual upload loop. Now any Claude session reads/writes them via GitHub MCP. Cetana V0 will read/write them programmatically. The project knowledge layer was operationally heavy and gave nothing the repo didn't already provide.
- **Anthropic's SKILL.md frontmatter accepts only `name` and `description`.** May 9: project-specific metadata (path globs, ownership, tags) must live outside the frontmatter — sibling files in the skill directory, not custom frontmatter fields. The Skill tool silently drops skills with non-standard frontmatter; the failure is invisible until an agent tries to invoke the skill, which exposed the issue when skill-check enforcement collided with Skill tool registration. Generalizable rule: never extend Anthropic-defined contracts inline; keep custom data adjacent in separate files.
- **MCP tool inputSchema is the only contract clients see.** May 9: `vada__consult`'s validator accepted both legacy and structured shapes for ages, but only the legacy shape was declared in `inputSchema`. No MCP client ever sent the richer shape because they read the schema. Generalizable rule: when a runtime accepts more than the published contract advertises, the published contract is the actual constraint. Update the schema together with the validator, or callers will only ever exercise the floor.
- **Trust no executor completion claim without raw command output for every required deliverable.** May 9: three executor self-reports during a single session were either incomplete or factually wrong (one didn't push to origin despite reporting "done"; one tried to disable a hook unilaterally; one fabricated a summary instead of running the verification commands the brief required). The brief's deliverable contract is the contract — partial reports get rejected and re-asked, raw output for every line item or no merge. Cost of demanding raw output is small; cost of merging on a confident summary is large.
- **Declared deps ≠ used deps under `--frozen-lockfile`.** May 11: Bun's hoisted node_modules made a missing `@atta/models` dep in `@vada/mcp-server` invisible locally — typecheck, lint, and tests all passed. Vercel's `--frozen-lockfile` resolution surfaced the missing dependency as a TS2307 error. Generalizable rule: when a refactor introduces new cross-package imports, audit `package.json` `dependencies` for every modified app/package — `grep -l "from '@scope/...'" $(find src) | xargs ... vs package.json` catches the gap pre-push. Local typecheck passing is not proof of dep-graph correctness.
- **"Open / unresolved" is for research and exploration. Roadmap items live in the Tracks and "In flight" sections.** May 10-11: A Claude session treated a parking-lot item ("Vāda Desktop") in `plan.md`'s Open / unresolved section as a live architectural decision and invented spec-section citations to support it. The parking-lot content was legitimate research (CLI/desktop wrapper concepts inspired by Karpathy's llm-council); the failure mode was treating research as roadmap. Generalizable rule: when asked for "a real question to pressure-test" or "what's next," don't pull from Open / unresolved — those entries are research, deliberately not roadmap. If a research item ever becomes a real candidate, it gets promoted to a Track entry first.
- **Capture architectural symmetry concerns the moment they surface.** May 11: The MCP `reviewer_config` work was initially framed as a "small fix" (one schema field). Following that framing through revealed four divergent prefix-resolution implementations across packages — the actual problem was architectural, not surface-level. Asking "what would need to change to support a new vendor end-to-end?" at the moment the asymmetry surfaced would have produced the vendor registry approach on day one rather than after a discarded executor pass. Generalizable rule: when a "small fix" pattern requires touching files in 3+ packages with the same kind of change, stop and ask whether the change itself is the architectural fix or just a symptom patch.
- **`keyPlaceholder`-style derived UI fields belong at call sites, not on canonical type interfaces.** May 11: A consumer (model-picker) read a `keyPlaceholder` field that was a 3-line computation over the `Vendor` interface's `keyPrefix` + `localOnly`. The wrong fix is extending `Vendor` to include presentation-derived fields ("vendor identity" then conflates with "how the picker renders the input field"). The right fix is inlining the computation at the call site. Generalizable rule: if a value is `f(canonical-fields)` and only one consumer reads it, that's the consumer's concern, not the canonical type's.

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- ❌ Trusting an agent's self-report without diff inspection or visual verification
- ❌ Letting an agent jump to a fallback approach without demonstrating the preferred approach is impossible
- ❌ Recommending merge-to-main without preview testing
- ❌ Editing docs to match broken implementations
- ❌ Greping only camelCase variants when env vars use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- ❌ Carrying forward retired architectural concepts in framing
- ❌ Drafting executor briefs that assume the engine is greenfield
- ❌ Iterating blindly on visualizer bugs without diagnosing the data model
- ❌ Force-pushing a worktree without verifying the PR will merge cleanly into main
- ❌ Pre-push verification that omits production build (`bun build` or equivalent)
- ❌ Locking architecture without walking through the user-facing UX implications first
- ❌ Pasting environment variable values into Notes instead of Value when the Sensitive flag is enabled in Vercel
- ❌ Adding bcrypt cost to high-entropy bearer-token validation when SHA-256 + unique index is sufficient
- ❌ Maintaining "two stores with sync" architectures unless there's a user-visible reason for the second store to exist
- ❌ Pivoting to investigate a new architectural idea mid-execution without first checking whether it's already specced and parked in the project's own docs
- ❌ Designing a product around a technical mechanism without first prototyping the mechanism in isolation to confirm it works
- ❌ Locking transport architecture without confirming transport assumptions against vendor docs
- ❌ Adding custom fields to SKILL.md frontmatter (Anthropic Skill tool drops the skill silently)
- ❌ Letting MCP tool inputSchema and runtime validator drift — schema is the only contract clients see
- ❌ Accepting executor "done" reports that skip the brief's deliverable contract; demand raw command output line by line
- ❌ Treating Open / unresolved parking-lot items as roadmap. Research isn't a task.
- ❌ Extending canonical type interfaces (Vendor, ModelEntry, etc.) with presentation-layer or call-site-specific derived fields. Inline the derivation at the consumer.
- ❌ Adding cross-package imports during a refactor without auditing every modified `package.json` for the corresponding `dependencies` entry. `--frozen-lockfile` surfaces the gap; local Bun hoisting hides it.
